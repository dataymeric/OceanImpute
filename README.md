# Deep Learning for Data Imputation in Oceanography

This repository contains code from my Master's research internship, co-supervised at [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr) and [LOCEAN](https://www.locean.ipsl.fr) labs (Sorbonne Universit√©). Remote sensing provides essential data for monitoring ocean color and phytoplankton, which are important indicators of marine ecosystem health. However, missing data is a common issue in these observations, and addressing it is necessary to gain a complete understanding of ocean dynamics.

This project presents a transformer-based model designed to impute missing values in variables such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton size classes. The model captures spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations in 3D oceanographic data using self-attention mechanisms. The ability to handle sequences and multivariate data makes this approach a promising tool for oceanographic research.
